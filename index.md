And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things."

In the heart of Austria, beneath the surface of our beloved "Wiener Grantln" (Viennese grumbling), lies a vibrant and dynamic alternative scene that has been pivotal in shaping the hacker movement across Europe. At the forefront of this movement is *Metalab*, a legendary hackerspace founded in 2006. *Metalab* has become a beacon for tech enthusiasts and innovators, inspiring countless hackerspaces across Europe and beyond. From the renowned *Chaos Computer Club (CCC)* in Germany to *c-base* in Berlin, *NYC Resistor* in New York, and *Noisebridge* in San Francisco, these spaces share a commitment to fostering creativity, collaboration and technological innovation within an open and inclusive environment.

We invite you to join our community as we embark on a journey to reconnect with our roots. We are bringing together top researchers and developers to celebrate those who think differentlyâ€”the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, and the round pegs in square holes.

Whether you're a seasoned hacker or just looking for inspiration.
