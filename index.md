Nestled in the heart of Austria, **GDG Vienna Tech** we bring together distinguished researchers and engineers from all walks of life. Our focus is on **data systems and learning algorithms**. We aim to follow in the footsteps of Metalab, a pioneering Viennese hackerspace that has inspired countless others across Europe and beyond.

Beneath the surface of our beloved "Wiener Grantln" (Viennese grumbling), lies a vibrant alternative scene that has played a crucial role in the hacker movement across Europe At the forefront of this movement is *Metalab*, a hackerspace founded in 2006. *Metalab* which led to the emergence of hackerspaces across Europe and even across the Atlantic. From the renowned *Chaos Computer Club (CCC)* in Germany to *c-base* in Berlin, *NYC Resistor* in New York, and *Noisebridge* in San Francisco, these spaces share a commitment to fostering creativity, collaboration and technological innovation within an open and inclusive environment.

We are here to celebrate those who think differently: the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, and the round pegs in square holes. At  GDG Vienna Tech, we embrace this spirit and strive to create a space where unconventional ideas can flourish and where everyone is encouraged to explore the boundaries of what is possible. Join us as we continue this legacy of innovation and exploration.
