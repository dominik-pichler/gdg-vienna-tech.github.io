# ðŸ‘€ About Us
We are a members group of Google's world wide network of developer groups **(GDG)**, aiming to connect like-minded individuals passisonated and curios about all things considering **data systems in machine learning**.
To reach this goal, we offer a wide range of exciting events such as:

- Speaker Series
- (Paper)-Reading Groups
- Hackathons
- Social Gatherings/Events
- and many more exciting things to come ... 




Our vision is to build a strong, vibrant and energetic community that fosters the growth and development of all it's members. 
Everyone should be welcomed, especially those who think differently: the misfists, the rebels, the troublemakers and the round pegs in square holes that are curious about the world we live in.
We therefore strive to create a space where unconventional ideas can flourish and where every member is encouraged to explore boundaries.
So, don't hestiate, we'd like to welcome you in our group.
